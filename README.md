# Worktracker

A personal project for tracking remote work hours using Django.

This is a development app and not in production. You must [install Python and Django](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/topics/install/) and [create a virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html).

To run in shell:
    1. Activate virtual environment by running `source {venv-name}/bin/activate`. If your virtual environment's name is `django-env`, run `source django-env/bin/activate`.

    2. Spin up the server by running `python manage.py runserver`. This will set up a port on http://127.0.0.1.8000/.
    
    3. Create a user with an email and password.

    4. Log in to track time entries with notes for each time entry.
